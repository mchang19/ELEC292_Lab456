# ELEC 292 - Lab 4, 5, 6

Partners: Anna Yun and Magan Chang

## **Lab 4:** Heart Rate Monitor
  - Designing, building, programming, and testing a microcontroller-based photoelectric heart rate monitor. The monitor measures
    the heart rate in beats per minute (BPM) using a photo transmitter/receiver pair sensor.

## **Lab 5:** Magnitude and Phase Measurement
  - Designing, building, programming, and testing a microprocessor based AC voltmeter that displays both magnitude and phase.
    A function generator was used to generate two independent sine wave functions of the same frequency (~60 Hz). The two analog
    inputs were taken in by the voltmeter and passed through an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The Vrms magnitude of both inputs
    and the phase difference in degrees were displayed on an LCD.

## **Lab 6:** Interfacing Using Transistors
  - Designing, building, programming, and testing a microcontroller-based DC motor controller using optoisolators and MOSFETs.
    The controller controls the speed and direction of a DC motor using two Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) inputs and a timer-based
    interrupt. Users can use pushbuttons to manually control the speed and direction.

All labs used an EFM8LB1 microcontroller and were programmed in C.
